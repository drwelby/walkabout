Walkabout is system for adding georeferencing to paper maps. It's like Michal Migurski's Walking Papers[1], but designed for situations where things are less than ideal and the users may find themselves isolated. Because "the network is not always on" [2].

Goals are:

* Make the georeferencing human-readable
* Lower the CV processing demands (no SIFT)
* Make it run anywhere, including localhost

So far, it consists of a simple CGI script that poses as a WMS server. Given a WMS request, it returns a map collar with targets and georeferencing. This could be accessed from the net or run on localhost. The collar has a transparent center so it is just layered on top of other data.

Since it is a WMS server, the collar can be added to online maps such as OpenLayers or to desktop GIS software.

The targets are designed to be easily discoverable by CV algorithms. The text depicting the target lat/lons should be extractable and OCRable. The next step will be to write a decoder that can take a scan of a map with the Walkabout collar and return a world file, so the scan can be used in a GIS or served by a WMS server or whatever.

In the event the decoding service is unavailable, since the collar is human readable the end-user can still georeference the images using ArcMap, GDAL, NYU Map Warper, etc.

TO DO:

* Clean up the map collar server. It's a mess
* Match the output precision to the input coordinates
* Hack the GetCapabilites response so its OnlineResource urls are dynamically updated
* Get the decoder rolling
